This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Welcome on my first purely React APP !
After working on Gatsby and Next.js projects, I told myself that's time to work on native a React app to improve my skill in React (and maybe TypeScript), and because I'm passionate about cooking, what better than a recipe book!

## The fusion of WP and React
With Gatsby, I usually use WordPress has a headless CMS. So, in first time, I'll use Axios to get and post data from WP to my React app.

## Storybook to the rescue
To use an atomic design system, I'll add Storybook to my React app.

## Feel free to use it !
